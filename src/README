pb - directory containing the pb module (the ProfitBricks API manipulation code and some helper submodules)

test - test files for the PB API *WHICH YOU SHOULD NEVER RUN UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING!*

example.py - shows you how to create your own PB API tools in Python (all you need to do is import pb/api.py)

pbapi.1 - the man page (use man -l pbapi.1 in Linux to read it)

pbapi.py - executes API commands on the ProfitBricks servers using the pb module, call this from your own (bash, perl, etc.) scripts

pbcli.py - same as pbapi.py, but has its own console; suitable for human interaction, useless for scripting

update.sh - update script that tries to use git (if exists) to update the application; launched by pbcli.py at every run
