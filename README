=============================================
== ProfitBricks API Command-Line Interface ==
=============================================

Git sources, recommended: git://github.com/profitbricks/ProfitBricks-CLI-API.git
Zip sources: https://github.com/profitbricks/ProfitBricks-CLI-API/zipball/master

To set up using the git sources, use:
	git clone git://github.com/profitbricks/ProfitBricks-CLI-API.git

1. PREREQUISITES FOR LINUX
==========================

Installation instructions for Debian; replace apt-get with yum where appropriate

sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools
sudo easy_install suds

2. PREREQUISITES FOR WINDOWS
============================

First, iInstall Python-2.7.3 (must be 32-bit!) from:
  http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi
Second, install setuptools-0.6c11 from:
  http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe
and finally open a cmd window, change directory to C:\Python27\Scripts and run:
  easy_install suds

Only src/pbapi.py works in Windows due to limitations in the Windows Python.

This worked on Windows XP SP3 32-bit and Windows 7 SP1 64-bit (but in both cases
it was required to install Python 32-bit).

Note: A .msi installer is on it's way and will be available in the next version.

3. AUTHENTICATION SETUP
=======================

To avoid having to type your username and password or link to the authentication
file every time you log in, you create a file with the name default.auth and put
it in the current working directory, and write your ProfitBricks username on the
first line and your password on the second line. This is not required, but it is
recommended unless there is a risk of someone else reading the file and exposing
your password.

4. QUICK INTRO
==============

The pbcli application provides a friendly console. Use 'help' to get the manpage
(it loads the pbapi.1 man page) or 'list' to get see the available commands. The
pbcli interface supports tab completion, has basic history and allows you to set
a default working datacenter and wait after all provisioning operations until it
becomes available again.

5. SUPPORT
==========

The application will automatically update its self on Unix or Linux systems if a
git revision control application is installed. If an update is found, the system
will update from the repository and will restart the pbcli.py application. There
is no auto-update for pbapi.py, but you can always run update.sh yourself. To do
an update on other platforms (Windows), simply do a git pull.
