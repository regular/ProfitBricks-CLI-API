=============================================
== ProfitBricks API Command-Line Interface ==
=============================================

Git sources, recommended: git://github.com/profitbricks/ProfitBricks-CLI-API.git
Zip sources: https://github.com/profitbricks/ProfitBricks-CLI-API/zipball/master

To set up using the git sources, use:
	git clone git://github.com/profitbricks/ProfitBricks-CLI-API.git

1. PREREQUISITES FOR LINUX
==========================

Installation instructions for Debian; replace apt-get with yum where appropriate

sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools
sudo easy_install suds

2. PREREQUISITES FOR WINDOWS
============================

First step, install setuptools from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
then open a cmd window and run C:\Python27\scripts\easy_install suds (replace 27
with whatever version of python you have installed; this was tested to work with
Python 2.7 on Windows 7 x64)

3. AUTHENTICATION SETUP
=======================

To avoid having to type your username and password or link to the authentication
file every time you log in, you create a file with the name default.auth and put
it in the working directory of pbapi.py; write your ProfitBricks username on the
first line and your password on the second line. This is not required, but it is
recommended unless there is a risk of someone else reading the file and exposing
your password.

4. QUICK INTRO
==============

Use the pbcli.py application for a better interface. Type 'help' to get help (it
will load the pbapi.1 man page) or 'list' to get see the available commands. The
pbcli interface supports tab completion, has basic history and allows you to set
a default working datacenter and wait after all provisioning operations until it
becomes available again.

5. SUPPORT
==========

The application will automatically update its self on Unix or Linux systems if a
git revision control application is installed. If an update is found, the system
will update from the repository and will restart the pbcli.py application. There
is no auto-update for pbapi.py, but you can always run update.sh yourself. To do
an update on other platforms (Windows), simply do a git pull.
