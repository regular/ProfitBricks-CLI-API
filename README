===========================================

If you already installed a previous version, you don't need to do any of this

Installation instructions for Debian; replace apt-get with yum where appropriate

1. PREREQUISITES FOR LINUX
==========================

sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools
sudo easy_install suds

2. PREREQUISITES FOR WINDOWS
============================

First step, install setuptools from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
Then open a cmd window and run C:\Python27\scripts\easy_install suds (replace 27
with whatever version of python you have installed; this was tested to work with
python 2.7 on Windows 7 x64)

3. AUTHENTICATION SETUP
=======================

To avoid having to type your username and password or link to the authentication
file every time you log in, you create a file with the name default.auth and put
it in the working directory of pbapi.py; write your ProfitBricks username on the
first line and your password on the second line. This is not required, but it is
recommended unless there is a risk of someone else reading the file and exposing
your password.

4. QUICK INTRO
==============

Use the pbcli.py application for a better interface. Type 'help' to get help (it
will load the pbapi.1 man page) or list to get a list of available commands. The
pbcli interface supports tab completion, has basic history and allows you to set
a default working datacenter and wait after all provisioning operations until it
becomes available again.
