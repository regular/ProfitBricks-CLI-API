===========================================

If you already installed a previous version, you don't need to do any of this

Installation instructions for Debian; replace apt-get with yum where appropriate

1. PREREQUISITES
================

Install python:
	sudo apt-get install python

Install python setup tools:
	sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Download the latest stable version of suds:
	wget https://fedorahosted.org/releases/s/u/suds/python-suds-0.4.tar.gz
	tar zxvf python-suds-0.4.tar.gz

Install suds:
	cd python-suds-0.4
	sudo python setup.py install

2. AUTHENTICATION SETUP
=======================

To avoid having to type your username and password or link to the authentication
file every time you log in, you create a file with the name default.auth and put
it in the working directory of pbapi.py; write your ProfitBricks username on the
first line and your password on the second line. This is not required, but it is
recommended unless there is a risk of someone else reading the file and exposing
your password.

3. QUICK INTRO
==============

Use the pbcli.sh application for a better interface. Type 'help' to get help (it
will load the pbapi.1 man page) or list to get a list of available commands. The
pbcli interface supports tab completion, but it currently does not have history.
Use 'last' to execute your last command. This is useful in case the hardware was
in provisioning state which failed the command and you want to run it again.
